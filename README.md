## üß© Software Components
- `radar`: Reads analog signal from HB100 radar via MCP3008, applies FFT to extract velocity
- `camera`: Interfaces with the Arducam HQ camera using OpenCV
- `trigger`: Detects ball movement via IR and timestamps the event
- `logger`: Centralized logging utility with support for info/debug/error levels


## üìà Measurements
- **Ball Speed**: Derived from Doppler radar FFT
- **Launch Angle**: Calculated from camera frame trajectory
- **Spin Rate**: Estimated via frame comparison and motion blur/edge rotation

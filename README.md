### üß∞ Additional Components
- Resistors (10K, 100K, 1M ohm)
- Capacitors (0.1ŒºF, 1ŒºF, 10ŒºF)

## üß© Software Components
- `radar`: Reads analog signal from HB100 radar via MCP3008, applies FFT to extract velocity
- `camera`: Interfaces with the Arducam HQ camera using OpenCV
- `trigger`: Detects ball movement via IR and timestamps the event
- `logger`: Centralized logging utility with support for info/debug/error levels


## üìà Measurements
- **Ball Speed**: Derived from Doppler radar FFT
- **Launch Angle**: Calculated from camera frame trajectory
- **Spin Rate**: Estimated via frame comparison and motion blur/edge rotation

## üõ† Build Instructions

### ‚öôÔ∏è Raspberry Pi Configuration & Dependencies

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Update & Upgrade the System
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Install Required Build Tools and libraries
```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git libcamera-dev libcamera-apps libgpiod-dev libfftw3-dev libopencv-dev libgtest-dev
```
#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Enable SPI Interface (for MCP3008)

The MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter communicates with the Raspberry Pi over SPI.

1. Run the configuration tool:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
2. Interface Options ‚Üí SPI ‚Üí Enable
#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Install BCM2835 Library (for SPI communication)
```bash
wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.71.tar.gz
tar zxvf bcm2835-1.71.tar.gz
cd bcm2835-1.71
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
#### ‚úÖ Step 5: Clone and Build the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasjhook/launch-monitor.git
cd launch-monitor
./scripts/build.sh
./build/launch_monitor
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Testing with Google Test

This project uses Google Test for unit testing. Follow these steps to run the tests:

### Prerequisites

- Google Test framework installed on your system
- CMake 3.10 or higher

### Building and Running Tests

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build

# Generate build files
cmake ..

# Build the project and tests
make

# Run the tests
ctest
```

### Writing New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a new test file in the `test/` directory with the naming convention `*_test.cpp`
2. Add the new test file to `test/CMakeLists.txt`
3. Follow the existing test patterns using Google Test macros

Test files should use the TEST() or TEST_F() macros to define test cases, and use
the various EXPECT_* or ASSERT_* macros for verification.
